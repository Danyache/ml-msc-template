# ML project description
A simple and well designed structure is essential for any Deep Learning project - **simplicity, best practice for folder structure**. 



# Requirements
## libs
Specification of dependencies
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (An open source deep learning platform) 
- [ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) (High-level library to help with training neural networks in PyTorch)
## dataset
- A link to a downloadable version of the dataset or simulation environment. For new data collected, a description of the data collection process, such as instructions to annotators and methods for quality control.

**Install Dependencies**

You'll need Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks installed to do this project. 

If for some reason you choose not to use Anaconda, you must install the following frameworks and packages on your system:
* Python 3.7
* Pytorch x.x.x
* h5py
* python-socketio
* scikit-image



# Getting started

- The range of hyper-parameters considered, method to select the best hyper-parameter configuration, and specification of all hyper-parameters used to generate results.

# Project structure
A description of the computing infrastructure used.

# Todo
- [] hyper parameter search template
